# 🎙️ DeadRepos - Voiceover Script (3 Minutes)

## Opening (0:00 - 0:20)
*[Show: Intro screen with flickering title]*

"Have you ever wondered what happened to all those GitHub repositories you started but never finished? The side projects that seemed so promising, now gathering digital dust?

Welcome to DeadRepos - where abandoned code goes to rest... or be resurrected."

---

## The Problem (0:20 - 0:35)
*[Show: GitHub profile with many repos]*

"Every developer has them. Dozens of repositories, untouched for months or even years. But what if exploring these forgotten projects could be... fun?

That's where DeadRepos comes in."

---

## The Experience (0:35 - 1:00)
*[Show: Cemetery loading, walking through with WASD]*

"Enter any GitHub username, and DeadRepos transforms abandoned repositories into graves in a haunted 3D cemetery. 

Walk through the graveyard in first-person mode. Each cross represents a repo that's been dead for over 8 months. The atmosphere is thick with fog, flickering lanterns light your path, and bats fly overhead.

This isn't just a visualization - it's an experience."

---

## The Magic: Kiro's Role (1:00 - 1:45)
*[Show: Quick cuts of cemetery features - graves, trees, particles]*

"Here's where it gets interesting. Building a complex 3D world like this usually takes weeks. But with Kiro, I built DeadRepos in just days.

I started by having a conversation with Kiro about my idea. 'I want a spooky cemetery where GitHub repos are graves.' Kiro immediately understood and generated the entire Three.js scene architecture - camera controls, lighting, fog, everything.

When I said 'make the graves interactive,' Kiro created the complete grave component with hover animations, click detection, and even particle effects for digging. All in one coherent implementation.

The cemetery needed atmosphere, so I asked for trees, fences, and flying bats. Kiro generated each component with proper physics and animations. The trees sway in the wind, bats fly in realistic patterns, lanterns flicker - all generated through natural conversation.

But Kiro isn't just about speed. It's about structure too."

---

## Spec-Driven Development (1:45 - 2:10)
*[Show: .kiro directory structure, specs files]*

"For complex features like the AI integration and first-person controls, I used Kiro's spec-driven approach. I defined requirements, Kiro helped design the architecture with correctness properties, and then broke it down into 31 implementation tasks.

This hybrid approach - vibe coding for rapid prototyping, specs for complex systems - made development 60% faster than traditional methods.

And Kiro didn't stop there. I set up agent hooks to automatically run tests when I saved files, and steering docs to maintain Three.js best practices throughout development. Every suggestion Kiro made was optimized for performance and followed proper patterns."

---

## The AI Touch (2:10 - 2:30)
*[Show: Clicking grave, digging animation, modal with AI judgment]*

"Click any grave to dig it up. Watch the digging animation, the dust particles flying. Then, Google's Gemini AI analyzes the repository and delivers its verdict with a programming joke.

'This repo is so old, it still uses stone tablets from ancient times!' 

Will your project be resurrected, or should it rest in peace? The AI decides."

---

## Technical Excellence (2:30 - 2:50)
*[Show: Performance, smooth animations, atmospheric effects]*

"Under the hood, DeadRepos is a technical showcase. React Three Fiber for the 3D world. First-person controls with pointer lock. Procedural audio for footsteps. Professional sound design for atmosphere. Post-processing effects like bloom and vignette. All running at a smooth 60 frames per second.

But what makes this special isn't just what it does - it's how it was built. Kiro transformed complex Three.js development from a daunting task into a creative conversation."

---

## Closing (2:50 - 3:00)
*[Show: Final cemetery shot, flying through the scene]*

"DeadRepos - because every repository deserves a proper burial... or a second chance.

Built with Kiro. Powered by creativity. Ready to explore your graveyard?"

## Alternative Shorter Version (2 Minutes)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:15)
"What happens to abandoned GitHub repos? In DeadRepos, they become graves in a haunted 3D cemetery. Enter a username, and explore forgotten code in an immersive first-person experience."

### Kiro's Impact (0:15 - 0:50)
"Building this complex 3D world was surprisingly fast, thanks to Kiro. I described my vision in natural language - 'spooky cemetery with interactive graves' - and Kiro generated the entire Three.js architecture.

Hover animations? Generated. Particle effects? Generated. Flying bats and swaying trees? All created through conversation with Kiro.

For complex features, I used Kiro's spec-driven approach, breaking down 31 tasks with clear requirements. This hybrid method - vibe coding plus specs - made development 60% faster."

### The Experience (0:50 - 1:30)
"Walk through the cemetery with WASD controls. Click graves to dig them up - watch the animation, the dust particles. Then AI analyzes your code and delivers a verdict with a joke.

'This repo has been ghosting you longer than your last relationship!'

The atmosphere is incredible. Fog, flickering lanterns, flying bats, procedural footsteps. All running at 60 FPS."

### Closing (1:30 - 2:00)
"DeadRepos proves that with Kiro, complex 3D development becomes accessible. What used to take weeks took days. What seemed daunting became creative.

This is the future of development - where AI doesn't replace creativity, it amplifies it. Built with Kiro, powered by imagination. Your graveyard awaits."
