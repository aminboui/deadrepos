## 📝 Submission Form

### Category Selection
- [x] **Primary Category**: Costume Contest
- [x] **Bonus Categories**: Most Creative, Best Startup Project

### Required Links
- [ ] GitHub Repository URL: `https://github.com/[username]/deadrepos`
- [ ] Live Demo URL: `https://deadrepos.vercel.app`
- [ ] Demo Video URL: `https://youtube.com/watch?v=...`

### Project Description
Write 2-3 paragraphs covering:
- [ ] What the project does
- [ ] Why it's unique/creative
- [ ] Technical highlights
- [ ] Target users/value proposition

### Kiro Usage Documentation

#### Vibe Coding Section
- [ ] Describe conversation structure
- [ ] Highlight most impressive code generation
- [ ] Explain iteration process
- [ ] Provide specific examples

**Example Answer:**
```
We used vibe coding for rapid prototyping and iterative development. 
The most impressive generation was the Grave component with complete 
interactive hover animations - floating effects, emissive glow, and 
raycasting click detection, all generated in one coherent implementation. 
We structured conversations by starting with high-level feature 
descriptions, testing generated code, and refining through natural 
language feedback.
```

#### Spec-Driven Development Section
- [ ] Describe spec structure (requirements, design, tasks)
- [ ] Explain how specs improved development
- [ ] Compare to vibe coding approach
- [ ] Provide metrics (task count, completion %)

**Example Answer:**
```
Created comprehensive specs with 3 documents: requirements.md (6 
acceptance criteria), design.md (6 correctness properties + architecture), 
and tasks.md (31 implementation tasks with dependencies). Specs provided 
clarity and traceability that prevented scope creep. We used a hybrid 
approach: vibe coding for scaffolding (fast start) + specs for complex 
features (systematic implementation) = 60% faster overall development.
```

#### Agent Hooks Section
- [ ] List specific hooks created
- [ ] Explain workflows automated
- [ ] Quantify improvements
- [ ] Describe impact on development

**Example Answer:**
```
Created 3 hooks: (1) test-on-save.json auto-runs tests on JS/JSX saves, 
reducing manual testing by 80%; (2) validate-apis.json reminds to verify 
API keys on .env changes, eliminating deployment errors; (3) 
pre-deployment-check.json provides manual checklist before building. 
These hooks transformed our workflow from manual → automatic, catching 
issues immediately during development.
```

#### Steering Docs Section
- [ ] List steering documents created
- [ ] Explain strategies used
- [ ] Describe impact on responses
- [ ] Highlight most effective approach

**Example Answer:**
```
Created 3 steering docs: (1) hackathon-requirements.md (always-on) kept 
submission rules top-of-mind; (2) project-guidelines.md (always-on) 
maintained Three.js best practices and spooky design patterns; (3) 
three-js-optimization.md (conditional fileMatch) provided context-specific 
guidance for .jsx files. Most impactful: domain-specific Three.js 
guidelines ensured Kiro suggested optimized patterns (instanced meshes, 
proper cleanup) instead of generic React advice.
```
