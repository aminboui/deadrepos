# 🎬 Demo Video Script (3 minutes)

## Opening (0:00 - 0:20)
**Visual:** Show title screen with DeadRepos logo
**Narration:** 
> "Ever wondered what happened to all those GitHub repos you started but never finished? Welcome to DeadRepos - where abandoned code goes to rest... or be resurrected."

## Problem Statement (0:20 - 0:40)
**Visual:** Show GitHub profile with many repos
**Narration:**
> "Developers often have dozens of repos collecting dust. DeadRepos visualizes these forgotten projects in a spooky 3D cemetery, making it fun to rediscover old work."

## Feature Demo: Cemetery Exploration (0:40 - 1:10)
**Visual:** Enter username, load cemetery
**Actions:**
- Type GitHub username
- Click "Enter Graveyard"
- Show loading animation
- Cemetery appears with atmospheric effects

**Narration:**
> "Just enter any GitHub username. The app fetches all repos abandoned for 8+ months and transforms them into graves in a haunted cemetery."

**Highlight:**
- Moon and stars
- Floating particles (mist)
- Dead trees swaying
- Fence around perimeter
- Different grave styles (crosses and tombstones)

## Feature Demo: Navigation (1:10 - 1:30)
**Visual:** Navigate around cemetery
**Actions:**
- Orbit camera around scene
- Zoom in on graves
- Show hover effects (glowing, floating)

**Narration:**
> "Explore the cemetery with intuitive controls. Hover over graves to see them glow with eerie light. Each grave shows the repo name and has been dead for months."

## Feature Demo: AI Resurrection (1:30 - 2:10)
**Visual:** Click on 2-3 different graves
**Actions:**
- Click first grave (show digging animation)
- Modal appears with repo details
- AI generates joke
- Shows verdict: RESURRECT or RIP
- Click another grave with different verdict

**Narration:**
> "Click any grave to dig it up. Our AI examines the code, tells a programming joke, and decides if the repo deserves resurrection or should rest in peace. The AI considers factors like stars, language, and how long it's been abandoned."

## Technical Highlights (2:10 - 2:40)
**Visual:** Quick cuts showing:
- Three.js scene with post-processing
- Sound toggle button
- Different atmospheric effects
- Code editor showing .kiro directory

**Narration:**
> "Built with React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber for stunning 3D graphics. Features include:
> - Real-time particle systems for atmosphere
> - Procedural sound generation for wind and creaking
> - Post-processing effects like bloom and vignette
> - GitHub API integration with smart filtering
> - Google Gemini AI for code analysis"

## Kiro Usage (2:40 - 2:50)
**Visual:** Show .kiro directory structure
**Narration:**
> "Developed using Kiro's full feature set: vibe coding for rapid prototyping, specs for structured planning, hooks for automated testing, and steering docs for consistent quality."

## Closing (2:50 - 3:00)
**Visual:** Final cemetery shot with all effects
**Narration:**
> "DeadRepos - because every repo deserves a proper burial... or a second chance. Visit the cemetery today and see which of your projects deserve resurrection."

## Recording Tips

### Camera Movements
1. **Slow orbits** - show off the 3D scene
2. **Zoom to details** - graves, trees, moon
3. **Smooth transitions** - no jerky movements

### Audio
- Use calm, slightly spooky background music
- Clear narration (use good microphone)
- Keep sound effects audible but not overwhelming

### Lighting
- Record at night or in dark room for authentic spooky feel
- Screen should be bright and clear

### Editing
- Add subtle transitions between sections
- Include text overlays for key features
- Add GitHub/deployment URLs at the end
- Keep it under 3 minutes!

### What to Emphasize
1. **Visual polish** - This is Costume Contest category
2. **Atmospheric effects** - Moon, particles, trees, fog
3. **Interactive elements** - Hover, click, AI analysis
4. **Technical sophistication** - Three.js, AI integration
5. **Kiro usage** - Show .kiro directory briefly

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't spend too long on setup
- Don't show errors or bugs
- Don't talk too fast
- Don't forget to show the AI jokes (they're fun!)
- Don't skip the atmospheric effects
